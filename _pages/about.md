#### NUS SoC, 2020/2021, Semester I, Time and Venue TBA

**N.B. This is not the current semester's module for AY 19/20 Sem II! Please see LumiNUS for Bryan Low's module.**

This module introduces basic concepts and algorithms in machine learning and neural networks. The main reason for studying computational learning is to make better use of powerful computers to learn knowledge (or regularities) from the raw data. The ultimate objective is to build self-learning systems to relieve human from some of already-too-many programming tasks. At the end of the course, students are expected to be familiar with the theories and paradigms of computational learning, and capable of implementing basic learning systems.

We will be using the [Coursemology](http://coursemology.org/courses/1677) Learning Management System for the administration of this course.

N.B. We will be teaching and using the Python programming language throughout this class and Jupyter Notebook via Google Colab. We will using Python 3.x

## Class Structure
This class is a _flipped_ class, a variant of a blended class. Youâ€™ll watch the first part of the video lecture before coming to tutorial, and then watch a subsequent video recorded lecture post-tutorial, to further reinforce the tutorial. **There is no lecture in the lecture timing, except as noted in the schedule.**

### Tutorial Sessions
There will be tutorials for this class. As the class is flipped, these sessions will be the primary means by which we touch base with you and get to know you personally. Please do attend all of these sessions, as they will not be webcasted (although tutorial solutions will be distributed, you should come to the sessions to get the complete picture).

These tutorial session timings and venues are still subject to change. Please see NUSMods for the most up-to-date details. As an enrolled student, you are entitled to one tutorial placement, and need to attend that slot even if not optimal for you. Nicely, all of the tutorials slots come before (Monday-Wednesday) the class lecture slot on Thursdays.

## Course Characteristics

**Modular Credits**: 4.

**Prerequisites**: (CS2010 or its equivalent) and (ST1232 or ST2131 or ST2132 or ST2334) and (MA1101R or MA1311 or MA1506) and (MA1102R or MA1505 or MA1521)
